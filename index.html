  <h2>Reliable, Reputable, and Relatable</h2>

  <div id="job-description">Hello, My name is Johanne McClenahan. I want to help build web applications in the Spokane area to build up the community's economy. I’m currently looking for a job in the web application development field.<br><br>
    I would prefer to have a job in front-end web development as I have experience in HTML and CSS. However, I do have experience working with MySQL and will learn PHP by April 2023, so I’m not opposed to working in back-end development.
